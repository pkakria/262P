***Note: You can succesfully run TwentySix on repl.it with the uploaded tf.dB. If you want to generate the tf.dB again, then repl.it kills database generation at about 4MB due to possible memory limitations. If you want to test tf.dB generation, please download these files to your computer and run using the same instructions.
